# Vehicle Counter using OpenCV and YOLO

## Project Description
This project is a vehicle counter that uses OpenCV and YOLO for vehicle detection. It can detect and differentiate between various types of vehicles such as trucks, bicycles, cars, and buses. Each detected vehicle is assigned a unique tracker ID. The application also counts the total number of vehicles that pass through a specified region.

## Features
- Vehicle Detection: The application can detect various types of vehicles in a video stream.
- Vehicle Differentiation: It can differentiate between various types of vehicles such as trucks, bicycles, cars, and buses.
- Vehicle Tracking: Each detected vehicle is assigned a unique tracker ID for tracking its movement.
- Vehicle Counting: The application counts the total number of vehicles passing through a specified region.
